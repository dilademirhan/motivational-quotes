# 🌙 Moonlight Musings

Moonlight Musings is a simple and aesthetic motivational quotes website built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The website fetches inspirational quotes from a **free public API** and displays them dynamically with a soft, artistic design.

## Features
- Dynamic motivational quotes fetched from an external API
- Clean and minimal UI with a dreamy background
- Button to load new inspirational quotes
- Fully static website hosted on GitHub Pages

## API Used
- **ZenQuotes API**
- Endpoint: https://zenquotes.io/api/random

The API returns data in JSON format, which is processed using JavaScript and displayed as readable text on the website (JSON is not shown directly on the screen).

## API Limitation Note
The API used in this project has request limits in its free version.  
Because of this limitation, fetching a new quote may take some time and quotes may not refresh instantly.

## Live Website
